                <h2>Bradley Murrell</h2>
                <h3>Dog Trainer / Dog Walker / Dog Sitter</h3>
                <p>My name is Brad and I'm from New Zealand. I grew up in the countryside and had dogs beside me my whole life.</p>
                <p>Before coming to Sweden, I spent many years traveling Europe where I have done jobs with dogs including volunteer work in shelters and at a dog hotel in the Swiss mountains.</p>
                <p>I came to Sweden as a dog handler to take care of a very special dog. I fell in love Sweden and decided to stay.</p>
                <p>Since living in Sweden, I have become a professional dog walker working for Tassevärld in Stockholm. I have also become a qualified dog trainer and train dogs in my spare time as well as dog sitting.</p>
