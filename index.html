                <p>My name is Brad and I'm from New Zealand. I grew up in the countryside and had dogs beside me my whole life.</p>
                <p>Before coming to Sweden, I spent many years traveling Europe where I have done jobs with dogs including volunteer work in shelters and at a dog hotel in the Swiss mountains.</p>
                <p>I came to Sweden as a dog handler to take care of a very special dog. I fell in love Sweden decided to stay.</p>
                <p>Since living in Sweden, I have become a professional dog walker working for Tassev√§rld in Stockholm. I have also become a qualified dog trainer and train dogs in my spare time.</p>
